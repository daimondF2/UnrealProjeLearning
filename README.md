# Super Simple Parkour Game
I used some of https://www.youtube.com/@RubaDev tutorials to create this proj (its just a parkour with some coins)
# I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE COIN MODELS OR SOUND EFFECTS
(Still trying to figure out how to add the executable to github)
w a s d to move 
shift to use some staming speed, 
space to jump 
goal: collect coins

Bugs:
Stamina bar bug
Momentum could be fixed
No way to exit unless alt tab or other
--
cant figure out how to add main windows build of the game (executable)

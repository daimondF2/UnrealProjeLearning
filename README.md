# UnrealProjeLearning
I used some of https://www.youtube.com/@RubaDev tutorials to create this proj (its just a parkour with some coins)
w a s d to move shift to use some staming speed, space to jump goal: collect coins

Bugs:
Stamina bar bug
Momentum could be fixed

cant figure out how to add main windows build of the game (executable)
